In other words, one does not know what the original of Mark did look like
and arguments based on Mark are pretty weak.
 
But how is that connected to a redating of John?

In response to your note about the textual variations in Mark:  
the connection to John’s redating lies primarily in the literary dependence argument.  
If one assumes Mark’s original ending was lost or heavily edited,  
it weakens the traditional synoptic order and opens the possibility  
that John could have drawn from a much later theological context.  
Several scholars, including Crossan and Kümmel,  
suggest that Johannine material reflects post-70 CE developments in early Christian thought.  
This means the redating of John is less about chronology  
and more about recognizing evolving narrative intentions.  
It’s not so much a question of *when* it was written,  
but *why* it was rewritten to suit an emerging doctrinal agenda.
